# school-management-system
**Description**: 
Developed a SQL-based backend for managing student, teacher, course, and grade information in a school environment. The system organizes essential data for efficient administration, enabling tracking of student enrollment, teacher assignments, and grade records.

**Steps to Build the Project**

1. **Database Creation**
   - Create the tables: `Students`, `Teachers`, `Courses`, `Enrollments`, and `Grades`.
   - Establish relationships between tables using primary and foreign keys, linking students to courses, teachers to courses, and students to grades.

2. **Data Insertion**
   - Insert sample data into each table, such as student and teacher details, course offerings, and enrollment records.

3. **Question Explored**   
•  **Retrieve All Students' Names and Grade Levels**
•	**Get Unique List of Courses**
•	**Find All Teachers Hired Before 2020**
•	**Retrieve All Students Enrolled in a Specific Course (e.g., 'Algebra')**
•	**Count the Number of Students Enrolled in Each Course**
•	**Find All Students with Grades 'A' or 'B'**
•	**Modify the `Status` of a Student’s Enrollment to 'Completed' for a Specific Course**
•	**Add a Constraint to Ensure Only Grades 'A' to 'D' Can Be Inserted in the `Grades` Table**
•	**Find Students Who Are in Grade 10 and Enrolled After 2020**
•	**Retrieve Courses with More Than 3 Credits**
•	**Search for Teachers Whose First Name Starts with 'A'**
•	**Find Students with Email IDs Containing 'example'**
•	**Count the Number of Students Enrolled in Each Course (Using HAVING Clause)**
•	**Retrieve Students Enrolled in 'Algebra' Using a Join**
