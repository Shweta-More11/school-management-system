# school-management-system
**Description**: 
Developed a SQL-based backend for managing student, teacher, course, and grade information in a school environment. The system organizes essential data for efficient administration, enabling tracking of student enrollment, teacher assignments, and grade records.

**Steps to Build the Project**

1. **Database Creation**
   - Create the tables: `Students`, `Teachers`, `Courses`, `Enrollments`, and `Grades`.
   - Establish relationships between tables using primary and foreign keys, linking students to courses, teachers to courses, and students to grades.

2. **Data Insertion**
   - Insert sample data into each table, such as student and teacher details, course offerings, and enrollment records.

3. **Question Explored**
   **Q1. --Retrieve All Students' Names and Grade Levels--**
   **Q2. --Get Unique List of Courses--**
   **Q3.--Find All Teachers Hired Before 2020--**
   Q4. --Retrieve All Students Enrolled in a Specific Course (e.g., 'Algebra')--
   Q5. --Count the Number of Students Enrolled in Each Course--
   Q6.--Find All Students with Grades 'A' or 'B'--
   Q7. --Modify the `Status` of a Studentâ€™s Enrollment to 'Completed' for a Specific Course--
   Q8. --Add a Constraint to Ensure Only Grades 'A' to 'D' Can Be Inserted in the `Grades` Table--
   Q9. --Find Students Who Are in Grade 10 and Enrolled After 2020--
   Q10. --Retrieve Courses with More Than 3 Credits--
   Q11. --Search for Teachers Whose First Name Starts with 'A'--
   Q12. --Find Students with Email IDs Containing 'example'--
   Q13. --Count the Number of Students Enrolled in Each Course (Using HAVING Clause)--
   Q14. --Retrieve Students Enrolled in 'Algebra' Using a Join--
